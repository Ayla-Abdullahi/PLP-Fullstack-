#type casting is converting the data type of a variable to another type
y=1
x="2"
z=3.0
#so in order to type cast you just indicatte the type you want to set to and pull the variable to be type casted inside a brackets next to the type
x=int(x) 
y=float(y)
z=str(z)
print(y)
print(x*3)
print(z*3 )  # This will repeat the string '3.0' three times
